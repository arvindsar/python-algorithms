I have learnt lists, strings, stack, dictionary , queue in python what are remaining topics to learn in DSA in python give them in order

## AI answer
To learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python after covering lists, strings, stack, dictionary, and queue, the remaining key topics to learn in order are:

1.  Linked Lists
    
    *   Singly Linked List
    *   Doubly Linked List
    *   Circular Linked List
    
2.  Trees
    
    *   Binary Tree
    *   Binary Search Tree
    *   Heaps (Min/Max Heap)
    
3.  Graphs
    
    *   Graph Representation (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List)
    *   Graph Traversal (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)
    *   Shortest Path Algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall)
    
4.  Sorting Algorithms
    
    *   Bubble Sort
    *   Selection Sort
    *   Insertion Sort
    *   Merge Sort
    *   Quick Sort
    *   Heap Sort
    *   Radix Sort
    
5.  Searching Algorithms
    
    *   Linear Search
    *   Binary Search
    *   Depth-First Search
    *   Breadth-First Search
    
6.  Recursion and Dynamic Programming
    
    *   Recursion
    *   Memoization
    *   Dynamic Programming
    
7.  Greedy Algorithms
    
    *   Activity Selection
    *   Huffman Coding
    *   Kruskal's Algorithm
    
8.  Divide and Conquer Algorithms
    
    *   Merge Sort
    *   Quick Sort
    *   Strassen's Algorithm
    
9.  Hashing
    
    *   Hash Tables
    *   Collision Handling Techniques
    
10.  Advanced Topics
    
    *   Bit Manipulation
    *   Backtracking
    *   Sliding Window
    *   Two Pointers
    

This order covers the fundamental data structures and algorithms that are commonly asked in coding interviews and are essential for building efficient and scalable programs.
